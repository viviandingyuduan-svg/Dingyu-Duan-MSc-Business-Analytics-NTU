# 👋 Welcome — Enjoy Exploring My GitHub Space

Hi there, and welcome to my little corner of GitHub.
Here you’ll find the things I genuinely enjoy working on — the projects that keep me curious, motivated, and excited to build more.

This is where I mix:
💼 M&A case studies & deal analytics
📈 Equity research ideas & financial models
📊 Dashboards that turn data into stories
🐍 Python, SQL, and machine learning experiments
📚 Notes, insights, and deep dives under Wiki & Code

Think of this place as my personal playground, where finance meets tech, numbers meet strategy, and curiosity meets creativity.

⭐ Just Released: My First M&A Analysis Post
I’m excited to share my first long-form Wiki project:
👉 M&A Analysis in Southeast Asia (SEA)
https://github.com/viviandingyuduan-svg/Dingyu-Duan-MSc-Business-Analytics-NTU/wiki/M&A-Analysis-in-SEA-Areas

It’s a deep dive into:
🔍 Deal trends & sector patterns across Southeast Asia
💰 Valuation behaviour & acquisition performance
🌏 The rise of cross-border strategic buyers
📊 Data analysis + modelling to uncover what drives successful M&A deals
🧩 Insights written from both a finance and business analytics perspective

If you’re into M&A, corporate strategy, or data-driven finance, I think you’ll enjoy this one.

🌟 What’s Coming Next?
I’ll be sharing more things I love exploring —
from risk modelling to dashboard design, from Python workflows to market research pieces.
A calm, curious journey of building, learning, and improving.

Thank you for stopping by.
Feel free to browse, follow, or come back anytime, and I hope you enjoy the exploration as much as I enjoy creating these projects. ☕✨
